This class allows a common interface to encrypt extended ascii strings with various modes of operation. Currently supported are:
  * ecb
  * cbc
  * cfb
  * ncfb
  * nofb
  * ctr
The block encryption is handled by external classes, making this class extensible
Currently the block ciphers used are:
  * rijndael-128
  * rijndael-192
  * rijndael-256
  * serpent
This is compatible with php's mcrypt
